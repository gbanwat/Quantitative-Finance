https://github.com/gbanwat/Quantitative-Finance/blob/main/Financial%20Data%20Cleaning%20Pipeline/Financial%20Data%20Cleaning%20Pipeline.ipynb

## 📝 Overview

The **Financial Data Cleaning Pipeline** is an essential building block for quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, and financial machine learning workflows.
Raw market data—whether from equities, forex, crypto, or derivatives—is often **messy, incomplete, noisy, or unstructured**.
This project implements a **robust and scalable data-cleaning pipeline** using **Python, pandas, and NumPy** to prepare financial datasets for:

* Predictive modeling
* Algorithmic trading strategies
* Risk analytics
* Backtesting engines

The pipeline performs missing-value handling, outlier detection, normalization, and structural validation to ensure high-quality inputs for downstream models.

## 🎯 Objectives

* **Acquire and explore** real-world financial market datasets
* **Detect and remove** outliers and anomalies
* **Handle missing or corrupt data** using systematic imputation methods
* **Normalize or scale numerical features** for machine-learning compatibility
* **Export clean, validated datasets** ready for modeling and backtesting
