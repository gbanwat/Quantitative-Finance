[Financial Data Cleaning Pipeline.ipynb](https://github.com/gbanwat/Quantitative-Finance/blob/main/Financial%20Data%20Cleaning%20Pipeline/Financial%20Data%20Cleaning%20Pipeline.ipynb)

### 📝 Overview

The **Financial Data Cleaning Pipeline** is an essential building block for quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, and financial machine learning workflows.  

Raw market data—whether from equities, forex, crypto, or derivatives—is often **messy, incomplete, noisy, or unstructured**.  

This project implements a **robust and scalable data-cleaning pipeline** using **Python, pandas, and NumPy** to prepare financial datasets for:

* Predictive modeling  
* Algorithmic trading strategies  
* Risk analytics  
* Backtesting engines  

The pipeline handles **missing values**, **outlier detection**, **normalization/scaling**, and ensures **structural validation** for high-quality inputs to downstream models.

## 2️⃣ Moving Average Crossover Backtesting System

🔗 **Project Notebook:**  
[MA-Crossover Backtesting Engine.ipynb](https://github.com/gbanwat/Quantitative-Finance/blob/master/MA-Crossover%20Backtesting%20Engine.ipynb)

*A Python-based backtesting engine for multi-asset SMA crossover trading strategies.*

### 🚀 Overview

This project implements a complete **algorithmic trading backtester** using Python.  
It downloads historical stock data, generates SMA crossover signals, simulates trades, computes portfolio performance metrics, and plots the equity curve.

The system supports:

* Multiple tickers  
* SMA50 / SMA200 crossover strategy  
* Trade signal generation (BUY/SELL)  
* Portfolio value tracking  
* Sharpe ratio, drawdowns & cumulative return  
* Automated trade logs  
* Equity curve visualization

## 3️⃣ Time Series Stock Analysis Project

🔗 **Project Link:**  
[Time Series Analysis Project](https://github.com/gbanwat/Quantitative-Finance/tree/main/Time%20Series%20Analysis%20Project)

### 📝 Overview

This project provides a comprehensive **Python-based framework for analyzing, visualizing, and forecasting stock prices** using time series methods.  

It integrates:

* Data retrieval from Yahoo Finance  
* Statistical analysis and visualization  
* Time series decomposition (classical & STL)  
* Stationarity tests (ADF & KPSS)  
* Transformations to achieve stationarity  
* ARIMA modeling, prediction, and forecasting  

This framework is ideal for **quantitative finance**, **algorithmic trading**, and **financial data analysis**.
